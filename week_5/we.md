# Notes for Algorithm
```
Each of the following are elementary operations:

let number = 0;
number += 2;
console.log(number);
We can count up all of the elementary operations that an algorithm performs and call that its running time. So if a an algorithm performs n elementary operations, we say the running time is n.
