# Notes
## Objects
- We explored the essentials of how to define, access, and manipulate objects in JavaScript. We reviewed the most common way to create objects (const o = {}), accessing and setting properties on objects using string keys (o["key"]) as well as how to get a list of all the keys in an object (Object.keys(o)).

- you can use for...in 
  - use hasOwnProperty() to loop local property that the object has instead of checking the properties that they inherit from their prototype chian and method names
