# Notes!!!!!!

## Recursion!!!!!!

- You need to have a clear understanding what the function does
- You need to know where the function will stop and return it's base case
- You need to know how the fucntion will move one level from one (ex.n) to next level
- You need to make sure the function will return the recursive value, which is return the value after the function has completed all the calculation for that leve (f(n) will return before it process f(n-1), etc)

- ### Notes from Khan Academy
  - Each recursive call should be on a smaller instance of the same problem, that is, a smaller subproblem
  - The recursive calls must eventually reach a base case, which is solved without further recursion.
