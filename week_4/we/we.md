## SQL

Structured Query Language

### Why do we need databse

- size
- ease of updating
- accuracy
- security
- who's accessing and editing the data and who gets to access and control the data
- redundancy
- importance

### Relational Database Introduction

- Remove repetitive data
- use uniqiue identifier to draw links between tables
- as reference between different tables
- give a table a unique ID

  - #### Entity Relationp Diagram
    The hardest part is to figure out which data goes to which table so you can link each table afterwards
    - Entity
      - represents a person, place or thing that you want to track in a database
        - For example, student will be the container that will include all the students so the entity in this case will just be students
    - Attribute
    - Primary Key
    - Relationship
    - Cardinality
